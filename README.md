# Vega API Javascript SDK

Version: 0.43.0

This is the Vega API client, which can be used to produce transactions for the Vega gRPC API.

## Usage

For examples, see the [sample API scripts](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/sample-api-scripts/) repository, or check out the tests folder for basic usage.

## Browser usage

These transactions can be sent over [REST](https://docs.testnet.vega.xyz/docs/apis/rest/) or [GraphQL](https://docs.testnet.vega.xyz/docs/apis/graphql/) from a browser context. To sign these transactions with your keys, you will first need to sign the transaction with your Vega key, for which you will need [go-wallet](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/go-wallet).

As browsers don't support gRPC natively, to send transactions over gRPC you would need [`grpc-web`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web) or another solution.

## Tests

To run the full end-to end test, you will need to run an instance of go-wallet, and provide an address in an environment variable.

```shell
WALLETSERVER=http://localhost:1789 npm run test
```

In case you don't have access to one, for the sake of convenience, the following command will run the subset of tests that don't require a server:

```shell
npm run test:local
```

For pull requests, the full end-to-end test suite will run.
